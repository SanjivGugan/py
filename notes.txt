So our algorithm or the steps will be
as follows:-
1. Capture and store the
background frame. [ This will be
done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth
using color detection and
segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored
cloth by generating a mask. [ used
in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented
output to create a magical effect. [
video.mp4 ]


let's do some preparation to
save the video as the output.
For that we'll use the
VideoWriter_fourcc.

FourCC is a 4-byte code used to
specify the video codec. The list of
available codes can be found in
fourcc.org. It is platform dependent.
FourCC code is passed as
`cv.VideoWriter_fourcc('M','J','P','G')or
cv.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'MJPG')` for
MJPEG.


filename: Input video file
fourcc: 4-character code of codec used to compress the frames
fps: framerate of videostream
framesize: Height and width of frame
